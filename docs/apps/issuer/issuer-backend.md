# Issuer backend

The issuer backend is a service for issuing credentials to users. It will also store issued credential so they can be revoked.

Credential templates can be mounted to the docker container to be added to the internal database. There are also API endpoints to add, update and delete templates.

## Tech stack

The backend is based on nestjs, where all endpoints are published as rest api. The OpenAPI interface can be found at `/api`.

## Configuration

Configuration is done via environment variables. By default the service will use the `.env` file in the app folder, but for production you can pass the variables via the environment into the docker container.
The required variables will be checked on startup. If a variable is missing, the service will exit with an error message.

## Database

The backend is using `typeorm`, allowing to use different database. Right now it supports `sqlite` and `postgres`. The type is define via the `DB_TYPE` environment variable. The default value is `postgres`.

## Key management

Two different key management systems are supported by the backend.

- `file`: the keys are stored unencrypted in the file system
- `vault`: the keys are stored in a hashicorp vault instance

The type is set via `KM_TYPE`, the default value is `file`.

The implementation of other vault systems or other approaches are possible by implementing the `KeysService` interface.

## Authentication

Authentication is realized via open id connect. The JWT needs to have the role `issuer` to be able to access the endpoints.

## Health check

The service is exposing a health check endpoint at `/health`. It will return a `200` status code if the service is healthy.
